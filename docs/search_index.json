The things a set contains can be any mathematical object and are called its elements. We will denote sets with capital letters like \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and elements of sets with lowercase letters like \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If \\(a\\) is an element of the set \\(A\\) we will write \\(a \\in A\\) and if \\(a\\) is not an element of the set \\(A\\) we will write \\(a \\notin A\\). There are a number of ways one can define a set. If a set is finite, we can just enumerate all of its elements, like this \\[ A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}. \\] A set with an infinite number of elements can be defined by enumerating enough of its elements to indicate a pattern among them and then placing an ellipsis (\\(\\ldots\\)) at either end of the list to indicate that the list continues forever, for example \\[ B = \\{0, 3, 6, 9, \\ldots\\}. \\] A set with an infinite size can aslo be defined by specifying a characteristic property that all of its elements have. For example \\[ C = \\{x | x \\text{ is an even natural number}\\}. \\] Definition 1.2 The size of a set \\(A\\), also referred to as the cardinality of the set, is the number of elements in the set and is denoted by \\(|A|\\). The size of a set can be either finite or infinite. In the examples above, \\(|A| = 7\\) and \\(|B| = |C| = \\infty\\). There is one special set that contains no elements and whose size is zero, It is called the empty set and is denoted by the symbol \\(\\emptyset\\). If we are to define it using the notation above, \\(\\emptyset = \\{\\}\\). Definition 1.3 Given two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), it can happen that every element of \\(A\\) is an element of \\(B\\). In this case we say that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\) and we write \\(A \\subseteq B\\). If \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), but it is not equal to \\(B\\), we say that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(B\\) and write \\(A \\subset B\\). Examples. The empty set is a subset of any other set \\(A\\), i.e. \\(\\emptyset \\subseteq A\\). Any set is a subset of itself, \\(A \\subseteq A\\). \\(\\{a,b\\} \\subset \\{a,b,c,d,e\\}\\). \\(\\{0,2,4,6,\\ldots\\} \\subset \\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots\\}\\). 1.1.2 Operations on sets Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be two sets. We can form a number of other sets from the elements of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) via the following operations. The union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set containing both the elements of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\[ A \\cup B \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{x | x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B\\}. \\] The intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set containing the common elements of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\[ A \\cap B \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{x | x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B\\}. \\] The difference of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all elements in \\(A\\) that are not in \\(B\\): \\[ A \\setminus B \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{x | x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B\\}. \\] If \\(B \\subset A\\), then the complement of \\(B\\) is the set of all elements in \\(A\\) that are not in \\(B\\): \\[ \\bar{B} \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{a | a \\in A \\text{ and } a \\notin B \\}. \\] The Cartesian product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of all ordered pairs of elements, the first one being from \\(A\\) and the second from \\(B\\): \\[ A \\times B \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{(a,b) | a \\in A \\text{ and } b \\in B\\}. \\] Below are listed some commonly used sets and the letters used to denote them. They are represented using the so called blackboard bold typeface. \\(\\mathbb{N} = \\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) is the set of natural numbers. \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) is the set of integers. \\(\\mathbb{Q} = \\{x | x=\\frac{p}{q}, \\text{ where } p,q \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } q \\neq 0\\}\\) is the set of rational numbers. \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers. \\(\\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\mathbb{Q}\\) is the set of irrational numbers, e.g. \\(\\pi, e, \\sqrt 2\\) etc. \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) is the set of complex numbers. We have the following subset inclusions among the sets above: \\(\\mathbb{N} \\subset \\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\subset \\mathbb{C}.\\) 1.2 Functions 1.3 Polynomials Definition 1.4 A polynomial is an expression of the form \\[ P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\ldots a_1x + a_0. \\] Here \\(x\\) is considered to be a variable that can take any value and the \\(a_i\\)s are arbitrary real numbers called the coefficients of the polynomial. Each of the summands \\(a_ix^i\\) is called a term of the polynomial. The exponent of \\(x\\) in a term is called the degree of the term and the degree of the polynomial is the largest degree among its terms with non-zero coefficient. Some examples of polynomials are: \\(P_1(x) = c\\), where \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), a constant polynomial with \\(\\deg{P_1} = 0\\). \\(P_2(x) = 3x - 5\\), a linear polynomial with \\(\\deg{P_2} = 1\\). \\(P_2(x) = x^2 -3x + 2\\), a quadratic polynomial with \\(\\deg{P_2} = 2\\). \\(P_3(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x + 2\\), a cubic polynomial with \\(\\deg{P_3} = 3\\). Remark. The zero polynomial \\(P(x) = 0\\) is somewhat special. Even though it looks like a constant polynomial of degree \\(0\\), its degree is undefined as it has no non-zero terms. Definition 1.5 A root of a polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is a solution of the equation \\(P(x) = 0\\), i.e. a real number \\(a\\) such that \\(P(a) = 0\\). For polynomials of low degree, there are explicit formulas for their roots. Degree \\(0\\) polynomials have no roots. If \\(P(x) = c\\) and \\(c \\neq 0\\), then there is no \\(x\\) which can satisfy the equation \\(P(x) = 0\\). Degree \\(1\\) polynomials are trivial. If \\(P(x) = ax + b\\), then provided \\(a \\neq 0\\) there is a single root given by \\(x = -\\frac{b}{a}\\). If \\(b = 0\\), the root is \\(x = 0\\). Degree \\(2\\) polynomials can be solved using the quadratic formula. If \\(P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\), then the two roots \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) of \\(P\\) are given by: \\[ x_{1,2} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}. \\] The quantity \\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\) is called the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial. Depending on whether the discriminant is positive, negative or zero we can have the following cases: \\(\\Delta &gt; 0\\), then \\(P\\) has two different real roots. \\(\\Delta = 0\\), then \\(P\\) has one double real root. \\(\\Delta &lt; 0\\), then \\(P\\) has two complex roots which are complex conjugate. Examples. Let \\(P(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2\\). If we compute its discriminant we get \\(\\Delta = 1 &gt; 0\\) so we expect to have two different real roots. Indeed, we can factor \\(P\\) as \\(P(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)\\) and from here it is clear that the roots are \\(x_1 = 1\\) and \\(x_2 = 2\\). Let \\(P(x) = x^2 + 1\\). In this case the discriminant \\(\\Delta = -4 &lt; 0\\) so the polynomial should not have any real roots. We know that this is the case as there are no real numbers \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = -1\\). Let \\(P(x) = 0\\). The zero polynomial is again special as it has an infinite number of roots – any real number \\(x\\) satisfies \\(P(x) = 0\\). The above observations are summarized in a theorem, known as the fundamental theorem of algebra, that specifies exactly how many roots a non-zero degree \\(n\\) polynomial with complex coefficients can have. Theorem 1.1 If \\(P(x)\\) is a non-zero degree \\(n\\) polynomial with complex coefficients, then \\(P(x)\\) has exactly \\(n\\) complex roots, counted with multiplicity. As we do not know yet what a complex number is, what this theorem will mean for us is that an arbitrary non-zero degree \\(n\\) polynomial with real coefficients will have at most \\(n\\) real roots. Remark. There are explicit, albeit complicated, formulas for the roots of cubic and quartic polynomials. By a theorem known as the Abel’s impossibility theorem, we know that there are no solutions in radicals for polynomials of degree \\(5\\) or higher. This means that we cannot express the roots of those polynomials as expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to integer powers and taking of n-th roots, as in the quadratic formula. For example, the simple looking equation \\[ x^5 + x - 1 = 0 \\] cannot be solved in radicals. 1.4 Trigonometric functions 1.4.1 Trigonometric identities Pythagorean identity \\[ \\sin^2(\\alpha) + \\cos^2(\\alpha) = 1. \\] Sum and difference of angles identites \\[ \\begin{align} \\sin(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) &amp;= \\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) \\pm \\cos(\\beta)\\sin(\\alpha), \\\\ \\cos(\\alpha \\pm \\beta) &amp;= \\cos(\\alpha)\\cos(\\beta) \\mp \\sin(\\alpha)\\sin(\\beta). \\end{align} \\] Double angle identities \\[ \\begin{align} \\sin(2\\alpha) &amp;= 2\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\alpha) = (\\sin(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\alpha))^2 - 1, \\\\ \\cos(2\\alpha) &amp;= \\cos^2(\\alpha) - \\sin^2(\\alpha) = 2\\cos^2(\\alpha) - 1 = 1 - 2\\sin^2(\\alpha). \\end{align} \\] Power reduction identities \\[ \\begin{align} \\sin^2(\\alpha) = 1 - \\cos^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\alpha)}{2}, \\\\ \\cos^2(\\alpha) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\alpha)}{2} \\end{align} \\] "],["linear-algebra-1.html", "2 Linear algebra 2.1 Algebraic vectors", " 2 Linear algebra 2.1 Algebraic vectors Definition 2.1 An \\(n\\)-dimensional vector is an \\(n\\)-tuple \\(\\bar{x} = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\), where \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). The \\(x_i\\) are called the coordinates of the vector. We will denote the collection of all \\(n\\)-dimensional vectors by \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), i.e. \\[ \\mathbb{R}^n \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} \\{\\bar{x}=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) | x_i \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}. \\] This agrees with the already introduced notation for the Cartesian product of sets, i.e. \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is nothing more than the \\(n\\)-fold Cartesian product of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with itself \\[ \\mathbb{R}^n = \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{R}. \\] A priori this is just a set. We can equip it the following two operations: Addition of vectors: given two vectors \\(\\bar{x},\\bar{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) we define their sum to be the vector \\[ \\bar{x} + \\bar{y} \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} (x_1 + y_1, \\ldots, x_n + y_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n. \\] Scalar multiplication: given a vector \\(\\bar{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and a real number \\(\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) (also referred to as a scalar) we define the scalar multiplication of \\(\\bar{x}\\) by \\(\\lambda\\) to be the vector \\[ \\lambda \\bar{x} \\overset{\\text{def}}{=} (\\lambda x_1, \\ldots, \\lambda x_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^b. \\] The vector addition and scalar multiplication operations satisfy the following properties: Vector addition is associative: \\(\\bar{x} + (\\bar{y} + \\bar{z}) = (\\bar{x} + \\bar{y}) + \\bar{z}\\). Vector addition is also commutative: \\(\\bar{x} + \\bar{y} = \\bar{y} + \\bar{x}\\). There exists a special vector \\(\\bar{0}\\), called the zero vector, such that \\(\\bar{0} + \\bar{x} = \\bar{x} + \\bar{0} = \\bar{x}\\). There exists an inverse vector \\(-\\bar{x}\\), such that \\(\\bar{x} + (-\\bar{x}) = \\bar{0}\\). Scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition: \\(\\lambda (\\bar{x} + \\bar{y}) = \\lambda \\bar{x} + \\lambda \\bar{y}\\). Scalar multiplication distributes over addition of real numbers: \\((\\lambda + \\gamma) \\bar{x} = \\lambda \\bar{x} + \\gamma \\bar{x}\\). Scalar multiplication is compatible with multiplication of real numbers: \\(\\lambda (\\gamma \\bar{x}) = (\\lambda \\gamma) \\bar{x}\\). \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) together with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication is called an \\(n\\)-dimensional real vector space.
