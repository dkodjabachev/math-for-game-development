## Algebraic vectors

::: {.definition}
An *$n$-dimensional vector* is an $n$-tuple $\bar{x} = (x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$. The $x_i$ are called the *coordinates* of the vector.
:::

We will denote the collection of all $n$-dimensional vectors by $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e.

$$
\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\text{def}}{=} \{\bar{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) | x_i \in \mathbb{R} \}.
$$

This agrees with the already introduced notation for the Cartesian product of sets, i.e. $\mathbb{R}^n$ is nothing more than the $n$-fold Cartesian product of $\mathbb{R}$ with itself

$$
\mathbb{R}^n = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{R}.
$$

A priori this is just a set. We can equip it the following two operations:

1. *Addition of vectors*: given two vectors $\bar{x},\bar{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ we define their sum to be the vector

$$
\bar{x} + \bar{y} \overset{\text{def}}{=} (x_1 + y_1, \ldots, x_n + y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

2. *Scalar multiplication*: given a vector $\bar{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and a real number $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ (also referred to as a *scalar*) we define the scalar multiplication of $\bar{x}$ by $\lambda$ to be the vector

$$
\lambda \bar{x} \overset{\text{def}}{=} (\lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n.
$$

The vector addition and scalar multiplication operations satisfy the following properties:

1. Vector addition is associative: $\bar{x} + (\bar{y} + \bar{z}) = (\bar{x} + \bar{y}) + \bar{z}$.
2. Vector addition is also commutative: $\bar{x} + \bar{y} = \bar{y} + \bar{x}$.
3. There exists a special vector $\bar{0}$, called the *zero vector*, such that $\bar{0} + \bar{x} = \bar{x} + \bar{0} = \bar{x}$.
4. There exists an *inverse* vector $-\bar{x}$, such that $\bar{x} + (-\bar{x}) = \bar{0}$.
5. Scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition: $\lambda (\bar{x} + \bar{y}) = \lambda \bar{x} + \lambda \bar{y}$.
6. Scalar multiplication distributes over addition of real numbers: $(\lambda + \gamma) \bar{x} = \lambda \bar{x} + \gamma \bar{x}$.
7. Scalar multiplication is compatible with multiplication of real numbers: $\lambda (\gamma \bar{x}) = (\lambda \gamma) \bar{x}$.

$\mathbb{R}^n$ together with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication is called an *$n$-dimensional real vector space*.

<!--
::: {.definition}
A collection of vectors $\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n$ is said to be *linearly dependent* if there exist real numbers $\lambda_i$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$ with at least one $\lambda_i \neq 0$ such that

$$
  \lambda_1 \bar{x}_1 + \cdots + \lambda_n \bar{x}_n = 0.
$$
Otherwise, if the above equation is satisfied only if $\lambda_i = 0$ for $i = 1,\ldots,n$ we say that the vectors $\bar{x}_1,\ldots,\bar{x}_n$ area *linearly independent*.
